    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar.
        Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden.
        In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour.
        Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
        The bars will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray,
        make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring
        to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled,
        cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.
      </li>
    </ol>
